pyMorse
======

This is a library that enables the conversion of text to Morse Code.
Currently implemented is that standard / minimal Morse Code set.
Morse code operators would have applied additional conversions to abbreviate
the text content and encrypt it (not yet available).

Use Makefile to run, install or test.  A Runner class is used to provide
a simple text user interface to enable encoding and decoding.  No sound effects
(dots/dashes) are applied in this library.
